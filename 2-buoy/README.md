# Cluster 13 - Buoy Group
Team Members: Milan S, Daniel MS, Isabelle G, Giovanni M, Emily L


## Description
During the COSMOS 2022 Summer Program, we were in charge of creating a device to hold the water sensors and it's electronics. In order to do this, we utilized a buoy that would follow behind an autonomous motorized boat that would be able to use sensors to collect data about various features of the water. We collected data from the surface using a buoy with sensors attached, and data from underneath via a capsule lowered from the buoy. 


## Project Goals
Our goal for the buoys was to make one buoy a surface level sensor and the other have a capsule to get underwater data. Both buoys had temperature, solidity, and pH sensors. 


## Challenges
One of the challenges we encountered was the buoy that we were provided started leaking. We solved this by purchasing caulking and redoing the waterproofing. Another challenge was the sensor falling off which we solved by redesigning the mounts to have more surface area to grip the buoy with.


## Procedure
To create the buoys we first needed to come up with a plan of action. We decided to create two buoys one that scans surface level and another that can collect data from a variety of depths as a stretch goal. We first drafted out a plan of what we want to do and who would do what. Giovanni would be in charge of mounting the sensors and waterproofing the buoys, Milan and Daniel would be in charge of designing the layout of electronics and the hardware in the buoy, Isabelle would be in charge of the capsule design and waterproofing, and Emily would be in charge of sourcing parts. 

We then split up to work on our individual part while reconvening before each test day to check in and offer ideas to problems we were facing. When we were unable to come to an answer we asked our advisors for proposals of new solutions. After consulting our teacher helpers, we were able to successfully assemble the buoy and all it’s electrical and sensor parts.
