# Buoy #1:
## Objectives:
* Collect data via sensors that would be attached to the exterior of the buoy
* Communicate with base station in order to send data back to be analyzed

## Project Timeline

### 7/18
We created the first iteration of the CAD models to hold the sensors.[PH sensor](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/ea41564105b61a12bdf0fd28/w/d3fdfa1f7d79284eb63dc095/e/69df08fe40578d68010a607e), [TDS sensor holder](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/0d5282bba14a224c1724f533/w/94f34ff72025ca8cc00cb65f/e/ccd35523a7df853023de6571) and the [Tempature sensor](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/50829009a772264103478846/w/c708d828623270150ef75e4e/e/50d666d81c3724e23ea0e39a?renderMode=0&uiState=62ebf43992bb0f3bc595ef23/)

### 7/19
We finished printing out the sensor mounts and temprorily attached them to the buoy using hot glue.

### 7/20 
We took the buoy out to the pool to test how everything was working. We discovered that the TDS sensor needed to be more protected so we redesigned the cad model to have part of it extend underneath to protect the pins. ADD POOl PHOTO

### 7/21
We test fit the TDS sensor enclosure which worked so we temporarily attached it with hot glue.

### 7/22 
No changes to this buoy.(Brought buoy down to the pool to help boat team)

### 7/26
We designed and printed out a wire holder that when combined with hot glue makes how we run cables out of the buoy watertight.[TDS and PH wire holder](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/e784ea0fa94fbc70d4efa87f/w/58f1957ea31cdb04b8e44ff0/e/aa3c104410f8dd82f052ff10?renderMode=0&uiState=62e8186388345e1eae367053) [Temperature wire holder](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/c1e1077623cafe5e9a5d7832/w/577200b50c6ec7e4d29fced9/e/af7030dff21ce8a0d2977259?renderMode=0&uiState=62e818b192bb0f3bc58ca428). We also attached the sensors using epoxy so they would not fall off.

###7/27
The buoy flooded and we had to try to salvage the electronics. The buoy was also dropped, breaking the TDS sensor and the mounting of the PH sensor. We found out that the temperature sensor works properly but we need to replace the PH sensor due to water damage. We also had to replace the TDS sensor due to the pins being bent. Due to some of the sensors falling off of the buoy we redesigned the models to cover more surface area to create a better attachment point. We also had to reprint the sensor wire holders as we had to rerun the wires

###7/28
Finished rewiring the Buoy after finishing damage repairs

###7/29
The surface buoy had no problems.
