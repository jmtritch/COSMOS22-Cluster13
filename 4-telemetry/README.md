## Abstract
- Configured LoRa and worked with data acquisition (DAQ) and database teams
- Collected GPS data and combine with sensor data 
- Received data on server through onshore LoRa and ESP32 

## Methodology 
1. Sampling code to learn to use new hardware and software
2. Debugging software + electrical issues 
3. Collaborating with data acquisition and database teams to merge code into ESP 32

## Results
- LoRa radio could send across very long distances
- Miramar Lake - sensor data was successfully transmitted from one buoy to the server
- Challenges with the 2nd buoy
